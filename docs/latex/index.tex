 C++ Matrix client library which aims to support most features in the Matrix specification, as well as Element features for a great user experience.

{\bfseries{This library is very much work in progress.}} Expect things to change, and as such it is not suitable for use yet. If you wish to help implement some of the many Matrix features, feel free to do so in the form of a pull request.

libleet is the library that powers the backend for the work-\/in-\/progress Matrix client \href{https://git.speedie.site/speedie/stellar}{\texttt{ stellar}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Currently supports}{Currently supports}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Connecting to a Matrix instance
\item Logging in
\item Message (including attachment) downloading
\item Message sending
\item Room creation
\item User listing
\item Room listing (including those inside spaces)
\item Space listing
\item Aliases
\item Attachment uploading and downloading
\item Discovery
\item Refresh tokens
\item End to end encryption
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Can send encrypted text messages.
\item Currently {\bfseries{cannot}} send encrypted attachments, read encrypted messages, verify interactively or use key backups.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item VOIP
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Can retrieve TURN server credentials. Not much thought has been put into VOIP support, because I am not a big fan of how it is implemented in Matrix.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item And more trivial features that I don\textquotesingle{}t think are worth listing here.

If you use the meson build system, you can compile libleet like this\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily meson setup build -\/-\/prefix=/usr -\/-\/reconfigure}
\item {\ttfamily cd build}
\item {\ttfamily meson install}
\end{DoxyItemize}

To generate documentation\+: {\ttfamily cd docs; doxygen; cd ..}

If you\textquotesingle{}re compiling with Visual Studio, you can use the solution. I don\textquotesingle{}t use Windows so I don\textquotesingle{}t really know if it works very well. Please note that with this approach you must compile olm separately for Windows.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Design goals}{Design goals}}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Easy to use
\item Make use of C++ features
\item Support Element as well as possible
\item Be modern. libleet uses modern C++ features where appropriate
\item Simplify much of the junk so that developers can just focus on designing their user interface

See the Issue tracker, as well as \textquotesingle{}Not yet supported\textquotesingle{}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Examples}{Examples}}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
You can find examples in the examples subdirectory. For simplicity, they must all be compiled from the Git root directory, rather than dynamically linked.

In addition, \href{https://git.speedie.site/speedie/stellar-backend}{\texttt{ stellar-\/backend}} is a web API which may also {\itshape serve} (get it?) as an example for how to write a program to interface with Matrix using libleet.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
